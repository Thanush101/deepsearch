Data Visualization\n  - Helps compare values of vastly different scales on graphs\n  - Makes small values more visible when plotting alongside very large values\n  - Particularly useful in bar charts with wide-ranging data\n\n2. Feature Scaling in Machine Learning\n  - Helps normalize high-magnitude variables\n  - Reduces bias in model training\n  - Creates more comparable scales for different features\n  - Commonly used for income and other financial variables\n\n3. Real-world Applications\n  - Richter scale for earthquakes (logarithmic scale)\n  - Each increase of 1 on the scale represents 10x more power\n  - Used in loss functions for machine learning models\n  - Financial calculations and growth measurements\n\n• Benefits:\n  - Compresses wide-ranging values into manageable scales\n  - Maintains relative relationships between values\n  - Improves model accuracy and data visualization\n  - Helps handle exponential relationships in data",
